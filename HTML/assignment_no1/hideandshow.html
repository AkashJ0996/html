          <h2>Ghost Story</h2>
          <p>This happened in 2016 when I was in Kolkata. We (me, my husband and son) used to live in an apartment 
            on the second floor of an old building near Hoogly river. Actually it was a government allotted place to my husband.</p><br>
          
          <p>It was a normal day for us. At night we went to sleep around 11pm. My bedroom had a double bed facing a wall 
            which had television on it. The rest of the wall was empty except for a wall clock. The end of the wall had the 
            door through which we entered into the dining area. The door was closed and the lights were off. I was sleeping 
            in the middle of the bed with my husband and son on either side.</p><br>

          <p>At around 1pm (I will tell you how I got to know the time later), although in deep sleep, I sensed someone 
            staring at me. I cannot explain how I sensed it. I felt uncomfortable and opened my eyes when I saw something 
            bright hanging in the air at the end of the bed. I know it's funny but it actually resembled something like an 
            astronaut in their white suit except that the suit was bright. I could see it clearly. It scared the hell out of me. 
            I closed my eyes and started shouting for my husband to wake up.</p><br>

          <p>He woke up and switched on the light. Nothing was there. That's when I saw the time on the wall clock. 
            My hubby told me that I must have been dreaming but I don't think so. I remember seeing it clearly. Afterwards,
            we slept through that night peacefully but with the lights on which we did for the coming nights too. Nothing of this 
            sort happened again.</p><br>

            <p>Can anyone explain what had happened? Was I really dreaming? If not then what could it be? It was nothing like 
            the ghosts we see in movies. I don't understand what happened.</p><br></span>
